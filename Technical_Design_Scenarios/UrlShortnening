Requirements: 
- Given a UTRL we need to generate a shorter link
- Redirection to original link
- Users should optionally be able to pick cutsom link 
- Have an usable API for other websites
- expiring links


API: 
createURL: apikey orig url cutom alias username expire date
DeleteURL: api key: url key( string rep of the url)

DATABASE DESIGN:
NOSQL database 
URL: hash, orig, alias userID
USER: UserId, Name,Email CreationDate: datetime, LastLogin:datetime


Encomding Url:
Hash fuction


Issues: 
Multiple users same url not accepted
same url location (with ecoding) but different url

Workaround: add user details in url / add number increment (overflow?)

For url storage use hash based partioning (consistent hashing)


Load balancing
Between Clients and Application servers
Between Application Servers and database servers
Between Application Servers and Cache servers

Expired links deleted in db with another service
