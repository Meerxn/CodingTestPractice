Requirement:
A one-on-one chat with low delivery latency
Small group chat (max of 100 people)
Online presence
Multiple device support. The same account can be logged in to multiple accounts at the same time.
Push notifications

HIGH LEVEL DESIGN:
SENDER --> message--> CHAT SERVICE (Store message and relay message) --> message Reciever

USING HTTP this can be done but quite client centric and its not server centric


WE USE POLLING,Long polling and Web sockets

polling: sending conenction (to server){
    // waiting for new messages long polling is waiting we have a message
}


A way to get rid of running of polling is web sockets{
    bidrectional connection enabled  SENDER <---> CHAT SERVICE and Reciever <-----> Chat Service
}
Users connecting to load balancer which connect to API servers 
Users alos conenct to chat service with chat servers and present servers
Thirs part for notifications
