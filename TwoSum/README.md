What I learnt from Leetcode solution: 

I used their Approach one which showed to have a higher Complexity. Approach one included brute forcing by checking with every single element

Their approach proved to be way more efficient by using HASHMAPS. Hashmaps reduced the complexity by mapping the indexes and the values of the array together.
